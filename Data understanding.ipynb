    "There are some problems with this dataset. First, for missing values, there are 10527 records and because most of the features are categorical data so I think I could build different models with/without the missing values and compare the accuracy later to decide whether I will exclude missing value.\n",
    "Secondly, the major task is to predict the severity of the car accident and the target variable should be SEVERITYCODE which was 1 (damage only) and 2 (injury). And the number of records 2 is twice as many as record 1. So I used resampling to downsample the majority 2 to the same amount as 1 to eliminate the unbalance.\n",
    "Thirdly, to build the classification model, I will need to convert categorical values to numerical. I encode ADDRTYPE, COLLISIONTYPE, WEATHER , ROADCOND, LIGHTCOND to numeric values. Among WEATHER, ROADCOND, LIGHTCOND which has both ‘Other’ and ‘unknown’ values, I group these two into one value."

    "## Feature selection\n",
    "I selected ADDRTYPE, COLLISIONTYPE, WEATHER, ROADCOND, LIGHTCOND as the features. I intended to use SPEEDING, UNDERINFL (under the influence of drugs or alcohol when driving), and INATTENTIONAND (not paying attention when driving) because there is a high correlation between these and car accidents, but the data is not representative enough. They only contain the value ‘Y’ and ‘Unknown’. So I did not select these as my features."
